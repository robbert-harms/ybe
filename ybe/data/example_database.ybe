        Although it continues on the next line, newline breaks are not kept intact, for that, use the |- modifier.

        Due to the "|" operator, all newlines in this text will be kept intact.
        That is, this line will appear on a new line in the example file.
        The "-" operator at the end (i.e "|-") indicates we want to remove any pending new line at the end.

        Question: Which basic variants of line folding are there in Ybe?
    answers:
        - answer:
            text: 0 variants
        - answer:
            text: '1 variant: with or without the "|" operator'
            correct: true

        Since "text" is short for "text_markdown", you can use Markdown syntax to markup your document.

        For example:

        1. this is a list
        2. *with this in italics*
        3. **and in bold**

        This is a famous formula inline: $E=mc^2$ and this is a basic displayed formulae:

        $$ a^2 = b^2 + c^2$$

        And it all costs $0.0!

        Next to that, here is an image from Escher:

        And an inline hello world image:
