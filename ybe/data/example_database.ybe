        This text is prefixed with !markdown, meaning you can use Markdown syntax to markup your document.

        For example:

        1. this is a list
        2. *with this in italics*
        3. **and in bold**

        This is a famous formula inline: $E=mc^2$ and this is a basic displayed formula:

        $$ a^2 = b^2 + c^2 $$

        Next to that, here is an image from Escher:\
