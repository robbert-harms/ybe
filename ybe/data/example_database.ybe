    id: <some_random_string>
    text: |-
        Due to the "|" operator, all newlines in this text will be kept intact.
        That is, this line will appear on a new line in the example file.
        The "-" operator at the end (i.e "|-") indicates we want to remove any pending new line at the end.

        Question: Which basic variants of line folding are there in Ybe?

        This text uses Latex to format the text. As such, you can use Latex math operators, such as:

        \[E=mc^2\]

        which is a formula discovered in 1905.
        Or, in natural units ($c$ = 1), this formula can be written as:

        \begin{equation}
        E=m
        \end{equation}

        Question: Who discovered this formula first?
