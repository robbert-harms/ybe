Important:


Wish list:
    - scoring form
    - export to latex (add option to print question ID or not)
    - warning if multiple choice question has no:
        - correct answer
    - implement warnings system
    - gui?
    - write down format descriptions
        - i.e. which kind of values are allows and which are not
    - query functions
    - documentation




Documentation:
    - writing latex files with an own template:
        my_env = get_jinja2_environment(loader=ChoiceLoader([FileSystemLoader('/tmp/my_template/'),
                                                             get_jinja2_loader()]))
        write_latex_file(ybe_exam, '/tmp/test/test.tex', jinja2_env=my_env, render_kwargs={})


Quality checks on loaded exam:
    - unique ids on questions
    - f'A multiple choice question must have exactly 1 answer marked as correct, {s} marked.'
    - f'A multiple response question must have at least 1 answer marked as correct, {s} marked.'
    - f'No points set, while points is a required field.'
    - 'No text block defined in question.'
    - f'Multiple text blocks found {found_text_modes} in question.'
